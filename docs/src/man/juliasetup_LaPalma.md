# La Palma volcano setup

In this example, we will show how to create a 3D model setup for the 2020 La Palma eruption. We mainly focus on the LaMEM part; see the [GeophysicalModelGenerator](https://github.com/JuliaGeodynamics/GeophysicalModelGenerator.jl) package for more details on how to plot earthquake data etc.
