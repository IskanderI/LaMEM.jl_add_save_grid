# List of all functions

These are all functions that are available in the package, which can roughly be divided into two groups (running & reading LaMEM)

## Running LaMEM
```@autodocs
Modules = [LaMEM.Run]

```
## Reading LaMEM output back into julia
```@autodocs
Modules = [LaMEM.IO_functions]
```
