# LaMEM.jl
This is the Julia interface to [LaMEM](https://bitbucket.org/bkaus/lamem) (Lithosphere and Mantle Evolution Model), which allows you to start a (parallel) LaMEM simulation from julia, and read back the output files to julia for further processing.

See [GeophysicalModelGenerator](https://github.com/JuliaGeodynamics/GeophysicalModelGenerator.jl) for tools to create input models for LaMEM, from data.
